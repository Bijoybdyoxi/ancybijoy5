                <h1>HAPPY_VALENTINE'S_DAY</h1>
                <h2>'____"ANCY & BIJOY"____'</h2>
                <p>Ancy and Bijoy were childhood friends who grew up in the same neighborhood in Trivandrum. They went to the same school, played the same games, and shared the same dreams. They were inseparable, until one day, Bijoy had to move to Malappuram with his family for his father's job. They promised to keep in touch, but as the years passed by, they drifted apart.

                    Ancy missed Bijoy terribly, but she tried to move on with her life. She studied hard, got into a good college, and pursued her passion for Biotechnologist. She became a successful scientist for a Biotechnologist, The integration of natural sciences and engineering sciences in order to achieve the application of organisms, cells, parts there of and molecular analogues for products and services. She dated a few guys, but none of them could fill the void in her heart that Bijoy had left.
                    
                    Bijoy also missed Ancy a lot, but he tried to focus on his career. He studied Data Science, got a job at a "GOOGLE" company, and worked his way up the Doctor of Philosophy. He became a Data scientist, Uses data to understand and explain the phenomena around them, and help organizations make better decisions. He dated a few girls, but none of them could match the spark that Ancy had ignited.
                    
                    On Valentine's Day, 2024, fate brought them together again. Ancy was assigned to a new solar power plant that was being inaugurated in Swizterland. She was surprised to learn that the project was led by none other than Bijoy, who was also invited to the event as a guest of honor. She decided to attend the event, hoping to get a chance to talk to him.
                    
                    Bijoy was also surprised to see Ancy's name on the list of scientist who were the Senior Biotechnologist. He was nervous and excited to see her again, wondering how she was doing and what she would say. He decided to look for her at the event, hoping to catch up with her.
                    
                    They spotted each other at the same time, across the crowded hall. They felt a surge of emotion, as their eyes met and their memories flooded back. They smiled and waved, and made their way towards each other. They hugged and greeted each other, feeling a familiar warmth and comfort. They exchanged pleasantries and compliments, noticing how much they had changed and yet how much they had stayed the same. They decided to go for a coffee after the event, eager to continue their conversation.
                    
                    They walked to a nearby cafe, holding hands and chatting. They told each other about their lives, their careers, their families, and their dreams. They laughed and joked, and also apologized and confessed. They realized how much they still cared for each other, and how much they had missed each other. They felt a connection that was stronger than ever, and a love that had never faded.
                    
                    They decided to give their relationship another chance, and to make up for the lost time. They kissed and embraced, feeling happy and hopeful. They thanked fate for bringing them together again, and vowed to never let go of each other. They celebrated their valentine's day, and their new beginning, with joy and gratitude.
